Steps I've Learnt:

- install pipenv, and django
- run "pipenv install"
- start django project by using "django-admin startproject project_name ."
  - the period at the end suggests that the project shall be created inside the current directory.
- run a server
  - either do django-admin runserver
    - this might not work because settings are not configured inside the manage.py 
  - or do "python manage.py runserver 9000"
    - here, 9000 is the port number; by default 8000
- run the python present inside the virtual env:
  - "Ctrl + Shift + P" then search "Python: Select interpreter" 
  - Paste the virtual environment path inside it and add "/bin/python" at the end
- check out the installed apps inside the settings.py
  - you can remove apps you don't want
- create an app using the command "python manage.py startapp anyrandomname"
  - just add the name inside the original settings.py


Few Commands for pipenv:
- "pipenv --venv"
> To view the address of the virtual environment.
